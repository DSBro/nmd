      <br>
      <p> The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a       </p>
      <p> Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some       </p>
      <p> semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,         </p>
      <p> while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute      </p>
      <p> the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make    </p>
      <p> reasonable modifications.                                                  </p>

      <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      <br>
      <p>     "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the         </p>
      <p>     Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files          </p>
      <p>     created through textual modification.                                  </p>
      <br>
      <p>     "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been         </p>
